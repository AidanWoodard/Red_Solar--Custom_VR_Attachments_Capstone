# Red_Solar--Custom_VR_Attachments_Capstone
This project was my high school capstone project that combines a functional VR experience with custom VR controller attachments utilizing a bluetooth connection to the computer. Red Solar was the name of the video game, and all of the .cs files are my own work.
These files obviously do not build the whole game. This is simply my contribution.

This project is not being maintained. If you'd like to learn more and see what the project looks like, visit the project's site here: https://sites.google.com/view/vr-capstone/home

I apologize that the files are out of order.
